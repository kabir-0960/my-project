Project: Simple SVG Drawing Tool

This project is about creating a basic drawing app using the <canvas> element, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It lets users draw freely by clicking and dragging the mouse across the canvas.

The tool works by listening to mouse events like mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, and mouseout, which together allow smooth and continuous drawing.

HTML (Page Structure)

The webpage has two main parts:

Heading

A <h3> tag shows the title "SVG Drawing Tool".

Drawing Area

A <canvas> element with the id "drawingCanvas".

The canvas is 600px wide and 400px tall.

This acts as the surface where users can draw.

Script Section

A <script> block contains the JavaScript code that makes the drawing tool work.

CSS (Page Styling)

Body

The page is centered using flexbox (display: flex, justify-content: center, align-items: center).

The height of the page is set to 100% of the screen (100vh).

Canvas

A 2px black border is added to highlight the drawing area.

Background color is set to light grey (#f9f9f9).

JavaScript (How It Works)

Setup

The canvas is selected using getElementById.

A 2D drawing context is created with getContext("2d").

Variables (isDrawing, lastX, lastY) are used to keep track of whether the user is drawing and where the mouse was last placed.

Mouse Events

mousedown → Starts drawing and remembers the starting position.

mousemove → Draws lines as the mouse moves while clicked.

mouseup → Stops drawing when the mouse button is released.

mouseout → Stops drawing if the mouse leaves the canvas.

Drawing Process

beginPath() starts a new line.

moveTo(lastX, lastY) moves to the previous point.

lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY) draws a line to the new point.

stroke() makes the line visible.

The line is blue with a 2px thickness.
